## What is PNK?

PNK serves two primary functions in the Kleros ecosystem:

### üó≥Ô∏è Governance Rights
- Vote on governance decisions across the Kleros platform
- Participate in protocol upgrades and parameter changes
- Influence court creation and policy updates
- Shape the future direction of the ecosystem

### ‚öñÔ∏è Jury Participation
- Stake PNK to become eligible as a juror
- Higher stakes increase chances of selection
- Earn fees and coherence rewards for honest voting
- Choose specialized courts based on expertise

## Token Origins: Pinakions

The PNK ticker comes from **"Pinakions"** - small bronze plates used in Ancient Athens. Citizens' names were written on these plates and inserted into a randomizing machine that selected participants for juries and civil service roles.

![Ancient Pinakion](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200?text=Ancient+Pinakion)

This historical reference reflects Kleros' mission to democratize justice through random jury selection.

## How PNK Works in Kleros Court

### Jury Selection Process

1. **Staking**: PNK holders stake tokens in specific courts
2. **Random Selection**: For each dispute, random PNK are drawn from staked tokens
3. **Jury Formation**: Holders of selected tokens become jurors
4. **Appeal Process**: Larger juries are formed for appeals, requiring more PNK

### Economic Incentives

- **Coherent Jurors**: Earn arbitration fees + coherence rewards
- **Incoherent Jurors**: Lose staked tokens to coherent jurors
- **Court Specialization**: Higher rewards in specialized courts requiring expertise

## Why Kleros Needs a Native Token

### üõ°Ô∏è Sybil Attack Protection

PNK provides crucial protection against [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack):

- Attackers need 51% of staked tokens to reliably control outcomes
- Requires substantial economic resources to mount attacks
- Economic barriers scale with the value at stake

### üîí Attack Resistance Mechanisms

#### 1. Market Liquidity Defense
- As attackers buy PNK, it becomes scarce
- Each additional token costs progressively more  
- May not find 51% of PNK for sale at any time
- Much stronger defense than using ETH or other external tokens

#### 2. Economic Cost of Attacks
- Successful attacks damage Kleros credibility
- PNK value decreases, causing attacker losses
- Self-defeating economic incentives
- Attackers lose money even if attack succeeds

#### 3. Community Fork Protection
- **Last resort defense**: Community can fork to remove attacker holdings
- Market decides which version of PNK to use
- Similar to Augur's ultimate appeal mechanism
- Not possible with external tokens like ETH
