# Smart Contract Security

Smart contracts require enhanced security practices due to their immutable nature and high-value transactions. Our RABd (Review, Audit, Bounty, Deploy) process ensures maximum security before deployment.

## Security Classification

### Risk Rating Model

We follow the [OWASP Risk Rating Methodology](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology) used by the [Ethereum Bounty Program](https://bounty.ethereum.org/):

| **Impact â†’** | **Low** | **Medium** | **High** |
|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
| **High Likelihood** | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Medium Likelihood** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Low Likelihood** | Note | Low | Medium |

**Impact Categories:**
- **High** - Funds can be stolen, frozen, or significantly affected
- **Medium** - Temporary inconvenience or partial fund risk
- **Low** - Minor inconvenience or theoretical issues

**Likelihood Categories:**
- **High** - Easy to exploit, publicly known methods
- **Medium** - Requires specific conditions or moderate skill
- **Low** - Requires exceptional circumstances or deep expertise

### Finding Documentation

All security findings must include:
- **Clear description** of the vulnerability
- **Reproduction steps** with test cases
- **Impact assessment** using the classification above
- **Proposed fixes** when known
- **Code references** with line numbers

## RAB Pragma Standard

### Header Format

Every smart contract file must include a RAB pragma comment:

```solidity
/**
 * @authors: [@githubUsername, email@domain.com]
 * @reviewers: [@reviewer1, @reviewer2]
 * @auditors: [@auditor1, https://audit-report-url.com]
 * @bounties: [https://bounty-program-url.com]
 * @deployments: [90ed3a5e@0xb7faddf3ecd2402a7e48cea6d2637d90eeb5a7e6]
 */

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

### Status Indicators

**Active Status:**
```solidity
@reviewers: [@alice, @bob]  // Current and valid
```

**Stale Status:**
```solidity
@reviewers: [@alice*, @bob*]  // Outdated due to code changes
```

:::warning
RAB is never complete - contracts should never be deemed fully secure. Continuous monitoring and updates are essential.
:::

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Pre-Review

**Purpose:** Catch common issues before full team review

**Author Responsibilities:**
1. Ensure RAB pragma comment is present
2. Create issue: "Pre-Review \<ContractName\>"
3. Label: `priority:medium`, `status:available`, `type:maintenance`
4. Assign to a team member

**Reviewer Responsibilities:**
1. Review code on `main` branch only
2. Submit detailed findings in issue comment
3. Wait for author to implement fixes
4. Verify all changes and add name to pragma
5. Close issue when complete

:::caution Reviewer Commitment
Adding your name as reviewer means you approve the contract and consider it vulnerability-free to the best of your knowledge.
:::

### Phase 2: Full Team Review

**Enhanced Process:**
- Issue title: "Review \<ContractName\>"
- **Entire review team** assigned
- **Parallel reviews** submitted by all team members
- **Consensus building** on findings and fixes
- **All reviewers** add names to pragma

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] **Security patterns** - Checks-Effects-Interactions followed
- [ ] **Access controls** - Proper authorization mechanisms
- [ ] **Input validation** - All user inputs validated
- [ ] **Gas optimization** - Reasonable gas consumption
- [ ] **Error handling** - Appropriate revert conditions
- [ ] **State consistency** - No race conditions or inconsistencies
- [ ] **External calls** - Safe interaction with other contracts
- [ ] **Documentation** - Complete NatSpec comments

:::danger Review Limitations
Reviews are only the first step. Internal reviews have inherent limitations - third-party audits and bounties are essential for production readiness.
:::

## Audit Process (Recommended)

### Why External Audits?

Internal reviews suffer from:

| **Problem** | **Solution** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Dilution of Responsibility** | Third parties compete to find issues |
| **Author Blindness** | External eyes catch missed mistakes |
| **Statistical Limitations** | Multiple auditors increase discovery probability |

### Audit Workflow

**Preparation:**
1. Complete review process first
2. Create issue: "Audit \<ContractName\>"
3. Label: `priority:high`, `status:in-progress`, `type:maintenance`
4. Assign audit coordinator

**Execution:**
1. Select reputable audit firm(s)
2. Provide complete codebase and documentation
3. Coordinate audit timeline and communication
4. Collect all audit reports

**Follow-up:**
1. Post audit reports in issue
2. Assign critical/high findings to developers
3. Implement all recommended fixes
4. Verify fixes with auditors
5. Add auditors to RAB pragma
6. Close issue when complete

**Recommended Auditors:**
- Trail of Bits
- ConsenSys Diligence
- OpenZeppelin Security
- Sigma Prime
- Quantstamp

## Bounty Programs

### Benefits
- **Ongoing security** - Continuous vulnerability discovery
- **Incentive alignment** - Rewards proportional to severity
- **Broader coverage** - Community of security researchers
- **Cost effective** - Pay only for results

### Bounty Workflow

**Setup:**
1. Create issue: "Bounty \<ContractName\>"
2. Define bounty scope and rules
3. Set reward structure by severity
4. Launch on platforms like Immunefi or HackerOne

**Management:**
1. Monitor submissions continuously
2. Triage and validate findings
3. Coordinate with developers for fixes
4. Process rewards promptly
5. Update RAB pragma with bounty URL

**Reward Structure Example:**
- **Critical** - $50,000 - $100,000
- **High** - $10,000 - $25,000
- **Medium** - $2,500 - $5,000
- **Low** - $500 - $1,000

## Deployment Process (RABd)

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Final code matches reviewed version
- [ ] All critical/high findings resolved
- [ ] Gas optimization completed

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Deployment plan documented
- [ ] Emergency procedures defined
- [ ] Upgrade strategy (if applicable) clarified

### Deployment Workflow

**Preparation:**
1. Create issue: "Deploy \<ContractName\>"
2. Label: `priority:critical`, `status:in-progress`, `type:maintenance`
3. Assign deployment engineer

**Execution:**
1. Create deployment PR: `chore/deploy-<contract-name>`
2. Add commit hash and target address to RAB pragma
3. Concatenate all contract code in PR description
4. Get final approval from all reviewers
5. Deploy using verified tools (Remix, Hardhat, Foundry)
6. Verify source code on Etherscan/block explorer
