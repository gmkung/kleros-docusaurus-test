        { id: "d", text: "Built-in appeal mechanisms" }
      ],
      correctAnswer: "b",
      explanation: "Contracts must implement the IArbitrable interface for communication with arbitrators and handle dispute fees properly to cover arbitration costs."
    },

      id: 4,
      question: "How should a contract handle arbitration fees?",
      options: [
        { id: "a", text: "Pay fees after the dispute is resolved" },
        { id: "b", text: "Collect fees from users and pay arbitrator upfront" },

      correctAnswer: "b",
      explanation: "Arbitrable contracts should collect arbitration fees from disputing parties and pay the arbitrator when creating disputes to ensure jurors are compensated."
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "What happens when rule() is called on your arbitrable contract?",
      options: [
        { id: "a", text: "The contract should immediately execute the ruling" },
        { id: "b", text: "The contract should store the ruling and optionally execute it" },
        { id: "c", text: "The contract should forward the ruling to users" },
        { id: "d", text: "The contract should validate the ruling first" }
      ],
      correctAnswer: "b",
      explanation: "When rule() is called, contracts should store the final ruling and execute the decision (transfer funds, change state, etc.) according to the dispute outcome."
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      question: "Which function creates a dispute in Kleros?",
      options: [
        { id: "a", text: "createDispute(bytes calldata _extraData, string calldata _metaevidence)" },

        { id: "d", text: "newDispute(address _arbitrable, uint256 _fee)" }
      ],
      correctAnswer: "c",
      explanation: "The createDispute function in the IArbitrator interface takes the number of choices and extra data (like court selection) to create a new dispute."

        { id: "d", text: "3 (including 'Refuse to Arbitrate')" }
      ],
      correctAnswer: "c",
      explanation: "For binary disputes, use 2 choices. Kleros automatically adds 'Refuse to Arbitrate' as option 0, so ruling 1 and 2 represent the two sides of your dispute."
    },
    {
      id: 8,
      question: "How should you handle appeal periods in your contract?",
      options: [

        { id: "d", text: "Let users appeal directly to Kleros" }
      ],
      correctAnswer: "b",
      explanation: "Appeals are managed by the Kleros arbitrator contract. Your arbitrable contract doesn't need custom appeal logic - just respond to the final rule() call."
    },
    {
      id: 9,
      question: "What is the purpose of MetaEvidence in arbitration?",
      options: [
        { id: "a", text: "Storing dispute rulings on-chain" },

      id: 10,
      question: "Which court should most technical blockchain disputes use?",
      options: [
        { id: "a", text: "General Court (ID: 0)" },
        { id: "b", text: "Curation Court (ID: 1)" },

        { id: "d", text: "Any court - they're all the same" }
      ],
      correctAnswer: "c",
      explanation: "Different courts have different expertise requirements. Technical blockchain disputes should use courts with jurors who understand blockchain technology, smart contracts, and DeFi concepts."

## Basic Integration Example

```solidity
contract MyArbitrableContract is IArbitrable {
    IArbitrator public arbitrator;
    uint256 public arbitratorExtraData;
    
    struct Dispute {
        uint256 arbitratorDisputeID;
        address requester;
        // Your dispute-specific data
    }
    
    function createDispute() external payable {
        uint256 cost = arbitrator.arbitrationCost(arbitratorExtraData);
        require(msg.value >= cost, "Insufficient fee");
        
        uint256 disputeID = arbitrator.createDispute{value: cost}(
            2, // Binary choice
            arbitratorExtraData
        );
        
        // Store dispute data...
    }
    
    function rule(uint256 _disputeID, uint256 _ruling) external override {
        require(msg.sender == address(arbitrator));
        // Execute ruling logic...
    }
}
```

## Key Implementation Tips

- âœ… Always check arbitration costs before creating disputes
- âœ… Handle fee refunds for overpayments properly
- âœ… Emit events for frontend integration
- âœ… Consider multi-party disputes and complex ruling logic
- âœ… Test thoroughly on testnets before mainnet deployment
