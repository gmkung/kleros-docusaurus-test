# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the Kleros developer documentation! This section provides comprehensive guides, standards, and examples for integrating with the Kleros ecosystem.

## Quick Start

Getting started with Kleros development:

1. **[ERC-792 Arbitration Standard](./arbitration-standard)** - Core standard for arbitrable contracts
2. **[ERC-1497 Evidence Standard](./evidence-standard)** - Standard for submitting evidence
3. **[Arbitration Examples](./examples)** - Real-world implementation examples
4. **[Deployment Addresses](./deployment-addresses)** - Contract addresses across networks

## Core Standards

### ERC-792: Arbitration Standard
The foundation of Kleros integration - defines how arbitrable contracts interact with arbitrators.

### ERC-1497: Evidence Standard  
Standardized way to submit evidence, metadata, and documentation for disputes.

## Integration Approaches

### Smart Contract Integration
- Direct contract-to-contract integration
- Custom arbitrable contract development
- Using existing arbitrable templates

### Application Integration
- Dispute resolution as a service
- Curated registry integration
- Identity verification with Proof of Humanity
