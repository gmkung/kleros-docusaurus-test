# Governance

Anyone can propose changes to core contracts powering the Kleros ecosystem. All changes need to be voted on and executed via community vote using PNK tokens.

## How Kleros Governance Works

The Kleros Protocol Governance process handles decision-making and enforcement for:

- üîß **Parameter changes** - Adjusting court fees, voting periods, etc.
- üìã **Contract deployments** - Deploying new versions or features
- üìú **Policy specifications** - Updating court policies and guidelines  
- üí∞ **Incentive structures** - Modifying rewards and penalties
- üöÄ **Protocol improvements** - Adding new functionality

The **PNK token** empowers holders with the capability to vote on proposals and collectively act as governors of the protocol.

## Kleros Improvement Proposal (KIP) Process

### Step 1: Create a KIP

Create a KIP (Kleros Improvement Proposal) post in the **"Votes"** section of the [Kleros Forum](https://forum.kleros.io/).

Your KIP should include:
- **Title** - Clear, descriptive title
- **Summary** - Brief overview of the proposal
- **Motivation** - Why this change is needed
- **Specification** - Technical details of the proposed changes
- **Implementation** - How the proposal will be executed
- **Security considerations** - Any potential risks or mitigations

### Step 2: Community Feedback

Engage with the community to:
- Receive feedback on your proposal
- Address concerns and questions
- Iterate and improve the KIP
- Build consensus before moving to vote

Update your KIP based on feedback until it can be considered **non-contentious**.

### Step 3: Snapshot Vote

Once your KIP has community support, publish a proposal on [Kleros Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/kleros.eth) for PNK token holders to vote on.

**Voting Requirements:**
- Voting is weighted by PNK holdings
- Proposals typically run for 7 days
- Quorum and approval thresholds apply

### Step 4: Implementation via Governor

If the Snapshot proposal is accepted, submit a list of transactions implementing the changes on [Kleros Governor](/products/governor).

The Governor contract:
- Accepts transaction lists for approved proposals
- Allows community challenges to incorrect implementations
- Automatically executes unchallenged transactions

### Step 5: Execution

If no one successfully challenges the transaction list within the challenge period, [Kleros Governor](/products/governor) automatically enacts the changes by executing the transactions.
