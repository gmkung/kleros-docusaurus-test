# Governance

Kleros operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where token holders participate in protocol governance and key decisions affecting the ecosystem.

## Governance Overview

Kleros governance follows the principles of decentralization, ensuring that no single entity controls the protocol's direction. Key decisions are made collectively by PNK token holders through various governance mechanisms.

## Governance Token: PNK

**Pinakion (PNK)** is the native governance token of the Kleros ecosystem, used for:
- **Staking in courts** - Required to become a juror
- **Governance voting** - Participate in protocol decisions  
- **Economic incentives** - Reward honest juror behavior
- **Fee payments** - Pay for arbitration services
