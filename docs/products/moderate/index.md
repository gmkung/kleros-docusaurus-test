# Moderate

Kleros Moderate is a family of content moderation bots that use Reality.eth with Kleros as an oracle for making moderation decisions. Get community-driven, transparent moderation for your social platforms.

## What is Kleros Moderate?

**Decentralized Moderation Solution** that combines:
- **Reality.eth** for crowdsourced decision-making
- **Kleros arbitration** for dispute resolution  
- **Smart contract automation** for transparent enforcement
- **Community governance** for moderation policies

## How It Works

### The Moderation Flow

1. **Content Flagged** - Community members or automated systems flag potentially problematic content
2. **Reality.eth Question** - A structured question is posed: "Does this content violate community rules?"
3. **Community Response** - Reality.eth users can answer and stake on their responses
4. **Dispute Resolution** - If challenged, the case goes to Kleros Court for final arbitration
5. **Automated Action** - Smart contracts automatically execute the moderation decision

### Key Benefits
