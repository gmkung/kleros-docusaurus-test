# Curate

üóÑÔ∏è **[Kleros Curate app](https://curate.kleros.io)** (mainnet) üóÑÔ∏è

**Kleros Curate** is a decentralized dApp that can be used to create open curated registries of just about anything using financial incentives and Kleros dispute resolution technology to ensure a list stays on topic and that each entry is compliant to the predefined acceptance criteria.

## How Curate Works

When a user submits an item to Curate, it is first vetted by a challenge period which allows anyone else to challenge that submission. If the submission isn't challenged, it's deemed legitimate and on topic. If it is challenged, the submission is sent to Kleros jurors to decide whether it is valid for the list in question.

## The Incentive Model

When you submit something to eBay or make a post on Facebook, you don't need a financial incentive, as those respective companies have plenty of their own to keep that list and its items on point. Facebook moderators are exposed to extreme content and are paid by Facebook to do so. You the user pay Facebook with your personal data which is then in turn used to keep extreme content out of your feed.

When there is no centralized actor to do the dirty work, you need some incentivized actors to take over.

## Creating Your List

You just have to follow [a step by step process](./tutorial) where you will be able to define:

- **Name of your list** - What your registry will be called
- **Accepted items** - Clear criteria for what belongs in your list  
- **Guidelines** - Rules that community members should follow in the curation process
- **Advanced options** - Parameters that give you control over how your list operates


Once your list is up, people will be able to submit items and other users will be able to challenge them.

## Contributing to Lists

Using the List Browser option, you can see lists created by other people and contribute to them by:

- **Submitting new items** - Add entries that meet the list criteria
