# Kleros Oracle

Kleros Oracle is a decentralized oracle solution that provides reliable, tamper-resistant data feeds for smart contracts and applications.

## Overview

The Kleros Oracle leverages the court system's dispute resolution mechanism to ensure data accuracy and reliability. It combines the security of blockchain with the wisdom of crowds to deliver trustworthy information to smart contracts.

## Key Features

- **Insurance**: Weather data, event verification, and claims processing
- **Gaming**: Random number generation and outcome verification
- **Supply Chain**: Product authenticity and delivery verification

## How It Works

1. **Data Request**: Smart contracts request specific data
2. **Data Submission**: Multiple reporters submit data with stakes
3. **Verification**: The community verifies data accuracy
4. **Dispute Resolution**: Disputes are resolved through the court system
5. **Finalization**: Consensus data is delivered to requesting contracts
