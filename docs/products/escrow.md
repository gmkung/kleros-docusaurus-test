# Kleros Escrow

**ü§ù [Launch Kleros Escrow ‚Üí](https://escrow.kleros.io)** | **‚öôÔ∏è [Smart Contracts ‚Üí](https://github.com/kleros/kleros-interaction/tree/master/contracts/standard/arbitration)**

Kleros Escrow is a secure and decentralized escrow platform for any exchange of goods, assets, or services involving Ethereum-based assets. Built with smart contract automation and Kleros dispute resolution, it brings traditional commerce-level trust to blockchain transactions.

## What is Kleros Escrow?

Kleros Escrow provides a secure intermediary service that holds funds in a smart contract until both parties fulfill their obligations. If disputes arise, they're resolved through Kleros Court's decentralized arbitration system with crowdsourced jurors.

## How It Works

2. **Service Delivery** - Receiver provides goods/services as agreed

5. **Final Settlement** - Funds distributed according to resolution

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- ETH for gas fees and transactions
- Clear agreement terms with counterparty

### **Quick Start Guide**

**For Payment Senders:**
1. **Connect wallet** to [escrow.kleros.io](https://escrow.kleros.io)
2. **Create new payment** with recipient details
3. **Deposit funds** into escrow contract
4. **Monitor progress** and approve when satisfied
5. **Handle disputes** if issues arise

**For Payment Recipients:**
1. **Receive escrow link** from payment sender
2. **Review terms** and agreement details
3. **Provide service** as specified in agreement
4. **Request payment** once work completed
5. **Participate in disputes** if necessary

## Economic Model

### **Fee Structure**
- **No platform fees** - Direct peer-to-peer transactions
- **Gas fees only** - Standard Ethereum network costs  
- **Dispute costs** - Arbitration fees only if disputes arise
- **Winner reimbursement** - Winning party gets fees refunded

### **Dispute Economics**

**Arbitration Fees:**
```
Base Cost: ~$50-200 depending on case complexity
Payment: Split between disputing parties initially
Reimbursement: Winner receives full fee refund
Penalty: Loser bears the arbitration cost
```

**Appeal Process:**
```
First Appeal: 3x base arbitration fee
Second Appeal: 9x base arbitration fee  
Final Appeal: Supreme Court with highest stakes
Economic Security: Higher costs deter frivolous disputes
```
