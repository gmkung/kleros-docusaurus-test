**Kleros Escrow** is a secure and decentralized escrow dApp that can be used for any exchange of goods, assets, or services involving an Ethereum-based asset.

Using Kleros Escrow, you can transact in the blockchain ecosystem for services, products, and assets using our simple solution with a level of trust not yet known outside the traditional commerce space. If a dispute happens, it will be adjudicated by crowdsourced jurors selected and incentivized by the Kleros protocol.
