# Proof of Humanity

ðŸ‘¤ **[Proof of Humanity App](https://proofofhumanity.id/)** ðŸ‘¤


**Proof of Humanity** is a system combining social verification with video submission in order to create a Sybil-proof list of humans. It serves as a point-of-entry to a myriad of new use cases that require Sybil-resistance to be deployed at scale and can be plugged into various existing and new applications needing such identity systems.

Building this advanced identity registry is not an end in itself - it's the foundation for countless applications requiring human verification and Sybil-resistance.

## Use Cases

### Universal Basic Income (UBI)

Universal basic income is a program for periodic payments delivered to all individuals with no strings attached.

The Proof of Humanity registry enables truly universal and fairer UBI distribution, where the only condition to receive payments is being registered as a verified human.

**Current Implementation:** A UBI project based on Proof of Humanity is already live as a collaboration between Kleros and Democracy Earth. [Learn more about the UBI token â†’](https://blog.kleros.io/proof-of-humanity-building-the-internet-of-humans/)

### Democratic DAO Frameworks

DAO frameworks using the PoH registry can experiment with truly democratic systems:

- **1 Person = 1 Vote** - Real democratic governance instead of token-weighted voting
- **Quadratic Voting** - More sophisticated preference expression
- **Innovative Governance** - New voting mechanisms requiring Sybil-resistance

The UBI DAO uses this approach to better account for every community member's voice. Similar systems can be integrated with DAO tools like Colony, Aragon, or DAOstack.

### Quadratic Funding

[Quadratic funding](https://wtfisqf.com/) creates optimal provision of public goods through a sophisticated matching mechanism:

- Citizens contribute to projects they value
- Funding received is proportional to the square of the sum of square roots of contributions
- **Requires Sybil-resistance** - Splitting contributions across accounts shouldn't increase funding
- **PoH enables this** - Ensures one person can't game the system with multiple accounts

This mechanism brings "Radical Markets" governance ideas into reality.

### Universal Identity & Self-Sovereign ID

**Universal Login:** PoH accounts can serve as universal identifiers - dApps recognize users automatically without registration.

**Enhanced Profiles:** Integration with identity systems like:
- 3Box - Decentralized profiles
- ENS - Ethereum Name Service
- Serto.id - Professional credentials
- Add Sybil-resistance to existing identity solutions

### Certification & Reputation Systems

Various certifications can be added to PoH profiles:

**Professional Certifications:**
- Country of citizenship
- Educational degrees
- Professional licenses
- Technical skills (e.g., "Experienced Solidity Developer")

**Verification Methods:**
- Central authority confirmation
- Curated registry validation
- Community attestation
- Code portfolio review

Users select which certifications to make public, displayed as badges on their profiles.

### Sybil-Resistant Distribution

**Traditional Problems:**
- Airdrops get Sybil-attacked despite identity requirements
- Balance-based distribution favors wealthy users
- Lock drops exclude those without existing holdings

**PoH Solutions:**
- **Fair Airdrops** - Each verified human gets equal allocation
- **Sybil-Resistant Yield Farming** - UBI token accrual without gaming
- **NFT Distribution** - Prevent hoarding by small minorities  
- **Subscription Services** - Prevent abuse of free tiers

### Anti-Spam Systems

**Current Problems:**
- Captchas waste user time
- Don't prevent determined spammers
- Can be outsourced or automated

**PoH Approach:**
- Verified humans get captcha-free interactions
- Spammers face permanent bans tied to their identity
- Can't evade bans by creating new accounts
- Reduces friction for legitimate users

### Novel Consensus Mechanisms

**Proof-of-Humanity Sidechains:**
- "1 Person = 1 Vote" consensus
- Similar to Proof of Authority but human-based
- Assumes honest majority of registered humans
- Enables truly democratic blockchain governance

**Other Applications:**
- Social recovery mechanisms
- Inheritance planning systems
- Community governance tools

## Privacy & Advanced Features

### Anonymous Sybil-Resistant Identities

Current PoH identities are public, but privacy-preserving extensions are possible:

**Technologies:**
- [Traceable Ring Signatures](https://eprint.iacr.org/2006/389.pdf)
- Zero-knowledge proof mechanisms
- Privacy-preserving attestations

**Applications:**
- **Anonymous Human Verification** - Prove humanity without revealing identity
- **Private KYC** - Prove citizenship or age without exposing personal details
- **Reputation Systems** - Demonstrate scoring without revealing transaction history

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Enable powerful privacy-preserving applications:

- Prove you're above a certain age without revealing exact age
- Demonstrate professional qualifications without doxxing
- Show community standing without exposing all past actions
- Enable anonymous but verified participation in governance
