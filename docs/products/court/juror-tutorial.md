# Juror Tutorial

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know to become a successful Kleros juror, from initial setup to advanced strategies.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- ETH for transaction fees
- PNK tokens to stake
- Basic understanding of blockchain transactions

## Step 1: Acquire PNK Tokens

### Where to Buy PNK

1. **DEX Aggregators (Recommended for large trades)**
   - [Paraswap](https://paraswap.io/#/) - Best price discovery
   - [1inch](https://1inch.exchange/#/) - Smart routing

2. **Decentralized Exchanges**
   - [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x93ed3fbe21207ec2e8f2d3c3de6e058cb73bc04d)
   - [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap)
   - [Balancer](https://balancer.exchange/)

3. **Centralized Exchanges**
   - [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/t/PNKETH)
   - [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/trade/PNK_USDT)

### How Much PNK to Start With?

- **Beginner**: 1,000-5,000 PNK (~$100-500)
- **Active Juror**: 10,000-50,000 PNK (~$1,000-5,000)  
- **Dedicated Juror**: 100,000+ PNK (~$10,000+)

More PNK = higher selection probability = more earning opportunities.

## Step 2: Access Kleros Court

## Step 5: Understanding Case Selection

### How Jurors Are Selected

1. **Random Drawing**: Kleros randomly selects jurors proportional to their stake
2. **Multiple Draws**: Your PNK acts like lottery tickets - more PNK = more chances
3. **Per-Vote Selection**: Each vote in a case requires a separate selection
4. **Time Window**: You have ~3 days to cast your vote once selected

### Selection Probability

Your selection chances depend on:
- **Your stake** vs. **total court stake**
- **Number of active jurors** in the subcourt
- **Case frequency** in your chosen courts

**Example**: If you stake 10,000 PNK in a court with 1,000,000 total stake, you have a 1% chance of being selected for each vote.

## Step 6: Participating in Your First Case

### When You're Selected

You'll receive notifications via:
- Email (if configured)
- Browser notifications
- Kleros Court interface alerts

### Case Analysis Process

1. **Read the Question**: Understand exactly what needs to be decided
2. **Review Court Policy**: Each subcourt has specific guidelines
3. **Examine Evidence**: Look at all submitted evidence carefully
4. **Research if Needed**: Use external sources when appropriate
5. **Make Your Decision**: Vote based on evidence and court policy

### Voting Interface

1. **Access the Case**: Go to court.kleros.io and find your active cases
2. **Review Details**: Read the case description, policy, and evidence
3. **Cast Your Vote**: Select your choice and click "Vote"
4. **Justify Your Decision**: Write a clear explanation for your vote
5. **Commit Vote**: Sign the transaction to submit your vote

## Step 7: Understanding the Voting Process

### Commit-Reveal System

Kleros uses a two-phase voting system:

1. **Commit Phase** (~3 days)
   - Jurors cast secret votes
   - Votes are encrypted and hidden
   - No one can see how others voted

2. **Appeal Period** (~3 days)
   - Votes are revealed automatically
   - Parties can appeal if they disagree
   - Majority decision determines the initial outcome

3. **Final Resolution**
   - If no appeal: case ends, rewards distributed
   - If appeal: case goes to next round with more jurors

### Vote Coherence and Rewards

- **Coherent Vote**: Vote with the majority → Earn rewards
- **Incoherent Vote**: Vote with the minority → Lose part of your stake
- **Reward Amount**: Proportional to vote stake and incoherent juror penalties

## Step 8: Writing Effective Justifications

Your vote justification is crucial for:
- Helping other jurors understand your reasoning
- Supporting the case in potential appeals
- Building your reputation in the community

### Good Justification Example:
```
Based on the court policy section 3.2, promotional content must clearly
disclose partnerships. The submitted evidence shows the influencer failed
to use required hashtags (#ad, #sponsored) in posts dated March 15-20.
Screenshots from Archive.org confirm these hashtags were missing during
the initial posting period. Therefore, the promotional content policy 
was violated.

Evidence reviewed:
- Screenshots: exhibits A, B, C
- Court policy: section 3.2
- Archive.org verification: exhibit D
```

### Poor Justification Example:
```
This looks wrong to me. I don't think this should be allowed.
```

## Step 9: Managing Your Staking Strategy

### Active vs. Passive Staking

**Active Strategy:**
- Monitor cases frequently
- Participate in most selections
- Higher earnings but more time commitment
- Requires staying updated on court policies

**Passive Strategy:**  
- Stake and participate occasionally
- Lower earnings but less time commitment
- Good for long-term PNK holders
- Set notifications for important cases

### Portfolio Approach

Consider diversifying across multiple subcourts:
- **70%**: Your area of expertise (higher accuracy)
- **20%**: General court (more case volume)
- **10%**: Experimental courts (learning opportunities)

## Step 10: Advanced Strategies

### Maximizing Earnings

1. **Policy Mastery**: Know court policies inside and out
2. **Evidence Analysis**: Develop systematic evaluation methods
3. **Historical Analysis**: Study past cases for patterns
4. **Community Engagement**: Join Discord/Telegram for discussions

### Risk Management

1. **Don't Overcommit**: Only stake what you can afford to lose
2. **Stay Informed**: Keep up with court policy updates
3. **Appeal Considerations**: Factor in appeal probability
4. **Coherence Tracking**: Monitor your vote accuracy over time

### Time Management

1. **Set Notifications**: Configure alerts for case assignments
2. **Batch Processing**: Review multiple cases in dedicated sessions
3. **Evidence Organization**: Develop templates for vote justifications
4. **Schedule Reviews**: Regularly check for new cases

## Step 11: Understanding Rewards and Penalties

### Reward Distribution

When you vote coherently (with the majority):
- **Base Reward**: Your proportional share of case fees
- **Coherence Bonus**: Redistributed stake from incoherent jurors
- **Appeal Rewards**: Additional fees if case goes to appeal

### Penalty Mechanism

When you vote incoherently (with the minority):
- **Alpha Parameter**: Determines penalty amount (usually 0.15-0.35)
- **Stake Loss**: Percentage of your vote stake is redistributed
- **No Total Loss**: You never lose your entire stake

### Example Calculation
- **Vote Stake**: 10,000 PNK
- **Alpha**: 0.2 (20%)
- **If Incoherent**: Lose 2,000 PNK
- **If Coherent**: Keep 10,000 PNK + rewards

## Step 12: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Critical Errors

1. **Not Reading Court Policy**: Each subcourt has specific rules
2. **Ignoring Evidence**: Base decisions on submitted evidence only  
3. **Poor Justifications**: Always explain your reasoning clearly
4. **Missing Deadlines**: You have limited time to vote
5. **Emotional Voting**: Stay objective and policy-focused

### Technical Issues

1. **Transaction Failures**: Always check if your vote was recorded
2. **Network Problems**: Use stable internet during voting
3. **Wallet Issues**: Keep your wallet connected and unlocked
4. **Gas Fee Planning**: Ensure you have enough ETH for transactions

## Step 13: Community and Support

- Try refreshing the page and reconnecting wallet

**Problem**: Not getting selected for cases
**Solution**:
- Ensure you have minimum stake in active subcourts
- Check that your stake hasn't been redistributed due to incoherent votes
- Verify you're staked in courts with active case volume

**Problem**: Can't find assigned case
**Solution**:
- Check all subcourts you're staked in
- Look in both active and past cases sections
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### Policy Questions

**Problem**: Conflicting evidence
**Solution**:
- Refer to court policy for evidence hierarchy

- Check evidence timestamps and authenticity

**Problem**: Unclear court policy
**Solution**:
- Review previous similar cases for precedent
- Ask for clarification in community forums (without revealing case details)
- Vote based on your best interpretation and document reasoning

## Advanced Topics

### Appeal Dynamics

Understanding appeals is crucial for experienced jurors:

1. **Appeal Cost**: Each round costs exponentially more
2. **Jury Size**: Doubles each round (3→6→12→24...)
